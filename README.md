# Smart Contract Security Audits

This repository contains my independent security audits of Solidity smart contracts.  
Each audit includes:  
- 📄 A full PDF report with findings, impact analysis, and recommended mitigations  
- 🧪 Test cases and proofs of concept (when relevant)  
- 📝 Notes on methodology and key learnings

## Methodology  

My audits focus on identifying:  
- Critical security vulnerabilities (reentrancy, logic errors, DoS risks)  
- Gas optimization issues  
- Best practices for upgradeability and maintainability  

Audits are written following structured reporting formats used in professional engagements.

## Next Steps  

This repo will be continuously updated with new audits as I work through different protocols and challenges.  
Stay tuned for more reports and deeper explorations into Solidity security.
